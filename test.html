I don't like to watch Horror movies because I can't sleep in the night after watching that kind of movies.

Since I can learn true events from it, I like to watch documentary movies.

I watched a comedy movie. I almost fell off my chair.

It takes a great deal of skill to make such funny movies without sound, without technical equipment, as Charli did.

Once, watching a sci-fi movie I thought that it must be exciting to discover other solar system.
